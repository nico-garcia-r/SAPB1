## How to use this module

To be able to execute the commands we must take into account that the objects that we find in SAP B1, either an input, button or menu are differentiated by IDs, and some of them are located within rows and columns. In order to know this data, we must activate the "System information" option found in the View menu, or press the Ctrl + Shift + I key combination. Then in the lower left corner we will be able to see the object data. It is important to take this into account when automating since it will be necessary to have the Form ID and Item ID, as well as the column and row, if applicable.
